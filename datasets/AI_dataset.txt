Now in the society, we are living on a world of machines. We depend on machines for every field of our life. Everything around us are applications of artificial intelligence. Air conditioners, cameras, video games, medical equipment ,were traffic lights, refrigerators, etc work on a “smart” technology . Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that works on to create a computer systems capable to react like a human being. That is to make machines capable of sensing the world around it, to understand conversations and to take decisions as a human would . Computers have more computational power than the human brain Now, computers are millions of times faster than they were fifty years ago. Human brains seem to be far “faster” than computers for a wide variety of tasks. Still, greater computational speed does make some so-called Artificial Intelligent systems seem smarter
Artificial intelligence (AI) have a great role in the field of robotics. Artificial Intelligence in robotics covers topics like natural language processing, design, human factors, and computing theory. Natural language processing, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, provides computers with the understanding they require to handle information being encoded by humans. Computer vision instructs computers on how to comprehend images and scenes. It has as some of its goals: image recognition, image tracking and image mapping. This application is valued in the fields of medicine, security, surveillance, military operations, even movie-making.
Since the beginnings of civilization man has had a fascination for a human-like creation that would assist him. Robotics and machines come to existence from this logic Artificial Intelligence to the Hollywood generation is mostly about androids, humanoids and robots. It is about machines going out of control, replacing humanity and world domination. There is a chance of happening this situation in future due to the influence of Artificial Intelligence. 
When we say intelligent machine it does not mean that it is a machine which can solve any complex program that even humans get troubled. Calculators are not intelligent. Calculators give the right answers to challenging math problems, but everything they “know” is preprogrammed by people. They can never learn anything new. Calculators are able to solve problems entirely because
people are already able to solve those same problems.
We have generated many computing devices that can solve mathematical problems of enormous complexity, but those were not actually intelligent. They are preprogrammed to do exactly what we want them to do. They accept input and generate the correct output. They may do it at blazingly fast speeds, but their underlying mechanisms depend on humans having already worked out how to write the programs that control their behavior. An intelligent machine is a machine that does not have any preprogrammed data in it to solve a problem. We can also say that it is a machine which have an ability to think.
The most famous of all uses for artificial intelligence systems is robotics.  Robotics is the study and development of robots Applications of artificial intelligence with robotics have taken into account in many Hollywood films. From the android Data in Star Trek, to C3PO in Star Wars, people have been engaged in science fiction with countless numbers of computerized robots. In today’s world, those types of robots are still fictional. However even today we use robots in countless applications. The automation of many assembly lines now, we use robots. For example, many auto manufacturers now employ the use of robots in many jobs which require a large amount of strength.
Robots have developed a lot by the last 50 years.
Robots now can ‘see’, sense, move and manipulate, executing complex and precise tasks at very high speeds. They have come a long way from the manufacturing field. Robotics have made a lot of progress with the influence of artificial intelligence. Today’s AI machines can replicate some specific elements of intellectual ability. Now with the help of artificial intelligence robotics is trying to create machines that will have the ability to learn just about anything, the ability to reason, the ability to use language and the ability to formulate original ideas.
Computers can already solve problems in limited realms. The basic idea of artificial intelligence problem solving is very simple, though its execution is complicated. First, the robot or computer with artificial intelligence gathers facts about a situation through sensors or human input. The computer compares this information to stored data and decides what the information signifies. The computer runs through various possible actions and predicts which action will be most successful based on the collected information. But, the computer can only solve problems which it is programmed to solve. It will not have any generalized analytical ability. Chess computers are one example of this sort of machine.
Some modern robots also have the ability to learn in a limited capacity. Learning robots recognize if a certain action (moving its legs in a certain way, for instance) achieved a desired result (navigating an obstacle). The robot stores this information and attempts the successful action the next time it encounters the same situation. Humanoid robots are one example of this application. Again, modern computers can only do this in very limited situations. They can’t absorb any sort of information like a human can. Some robots can learn by mimicking human actions.
Some robots can interact socially. Kismet, a robot at M.I.T’s Artificial Intelligence Lab, recognizes human body language and voice inflection and responds appropriately. Kismet’s creators are interested in how humans and babies interact, based only on tone of speech and visual cue. This low-level interaction could be the foundation of a human-like learning system.
Kismet and other humanoid robots at the M.I.T. artificial intelligence Lab operate using an unconventional control structure. Instead of directing every action using a central computer, the robots control lower-level actions with lower-level computers. The program’s director, Rodney Brooks, believes this is a more accurate model of human intelligence. We do most things automatically and we don’t decide to do them at the highest level of consciousness. For example we are not using our highest level of consciousness for closing our eyelids.
Artificial Intelligence has made it possible to interact with computers by using speech instead of writing by the application of computer speech recognition. The advantages of computer speech recognition can be seen in the Hollywood film ‘IRON MAN’.
Artificial intelligence has a great influence in the field of medicine. We will be able to get the treatment even if the doctor is not present. By taking the advances of sophisticated robotics and taking the advantages of computer vision and signal process technologies in artificial intelligence doctors will be able to direct robots remotely to treat patients. Computer vision instructs computers on how to comprehend images and scenes. It has as some of its goals: image recognition, image tracking and image mapping. This application is very valued in the fields of medicine, security, surveillance, military operations, even movie-making.
Since we are using robots for treating they will not get tired and will be more precise and accurate with with there treatment. For example, robots will more accurate with stiching than a human doctor can do.
Many soldiers have got killed in battle fields and have died because of not getting enough medical support. Machines with artificial intelligence can be sent to battle fields for treating the soldiers. Machines with artificial intelligence can be sent even in a space station or places humans cannot get very easily.
Even though nanotechnology and artificial intelligence are two different fields, they there are so many researches working on with the application of artificial intelligence in nanotechnology. Many progresses can be made by joing together the artificial intelligence and nanotechnology. Artificial Intelligence could be boosted by nanotechnology innovations in computing power. Applications of a future nanotechnology general assembler would require some AI and robotics innovations.
Nanotechnology with the help of artificial intetelligence and robotics is working on to create micro machines which can change the face of the world.There are so many application for this if these small nanobots came to exist . They can be used in every important fields of our life. They can be used in the field of medicine for treatment. They can be injected to the body with the medicine and will heal the decease.
Nanotechnology with artificial intelligence can be used in the field of military for increasing the effect and develop defensive shields. Today there is still no shield that can deflect a nuclear explosion; nations are protected not by defenses that cancel offenses, but by a balance of offensive terror. The developments in this field can save the lives of many on wars.
